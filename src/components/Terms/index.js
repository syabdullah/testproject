                        the Service, including all related intellectual property rights. No rights are granted

                        <strong>Retailer Data.</strong> As between Retailer and Spocket, Retailer will own and

                        <strong>"Retailer Data"</strong>). Retailer hereby grant Spocket a worldwide,

                        content; and (ii) create Pattern Data (as defined in Section 7.4 below). Together
                        Sections 7.2(i) and (ii) constitute the
                        <strong>"Content License"</strong>). Retailer understand that Spocket, in performing
                        the required technical steps to provide the Service, may (a) transmit or distribute

                        make such changes to Retailer Data as are necessary to conform and adapt that Retailer
                        Data to the technical requirements of connecting networks, devices, services or media.
                        Retailer confirm and warrant to Spocket that Retailer have all the rights, power and
                        authority necessary to grant the above Content License and that use of the Retailer
                        Data in the manner contemplated will not breach the rights of any third party.

                        all necessary licenses, permissions and consents to enable all material comprising
                        Retailer Data to be made available to Spocket for Spocket to transmit, host and store.
                        For greater certainty, Retailer shall: (i) have sole responsibility for the accuracy,
                        quality, integrity, legality, reliability, and appropriateness of all Retailer Data;
                        (ii) use commercially reasonable efforts to prevent unauthorized access to, or use of,
                        the Service and notify Spocket promptly of any such unauthorized access or use; and
                        (iii) comply with all applicable local, provincial, state, federal and foreign laws in
                        using the Service.

                        frequency and type of use of the Service, and popularity of the Service. For greater
                        certainty, Pattern Data is data that does not identify a specific Retailer, its
                        business contracts or its end users. As between Spocket and Retailer, all right and
                        title to Pattern Data belongs to Spocket and accordingly Spocket is free to use

                        <strong>Definition of Confidential Information.</strong> As used in this Agreement,
                        <strong> "Confidential Information"</strong> means all confidential and proprietary
                        information of a party (the
                        <strong>"Disclosing Party"</strong>) disclosed to the other party (the
                        <strong>"Receiving Party"</strong>), whether orally or in writing, that is designated
                        as confidential or that reasonably should be understood to be confidential given the
                        nature of the information and the circumstances of disclosure, including the Service,
                        business and marketing plans, technology and technical information, product designs,
                        and business processes. Confidential Information shall not include any information
                        that: (i) is or becomes generally known to the public without breach of any obligation
                        owed to the Disclosing Party; (ii) was known to the Receiving Party prior to its
                        disclosure by the Disclosing Party without breach of any obligation owed to the
                        Disclosing Party; (iii) was independently developed by the Receiving Party without
                        breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party; or (iv) is received from a
                        third party without breach of any obligation owed to the Disclosing Party.

                        <strong>Confidentiality.</strong> The Receiving Party shall not disclose or use any
                        Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party for any purpose outside the scope of
                        this Agreement, except with the Disclosing Party's prior written permission.

                        <strong>Protection.</strong> Each party agrees to protect the confidentiality of the
                        Confidential Information of the other party in the same manner as it protects the
                        confidentiality of its own proprietary and confidential information of like kind (but
                        in no event using less than reasonable care).

                        <strong>Compelled Disclosure.</strong> If the Receiving Party is compelled by law to
                        disclose Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party, it shall provide the
                        Disclosing Party with prior notice of such compelled disclosure (to the extent legally
                        permitted) and reasonable assistance, at the Disclosing Party's cost, if the
                        Disclosing Party wishes to contest the disclosure.

                        <strong>Remedies.</strong> If the Receiving Party discloses or uses (or threatens to
                        disclose or use) any Confidential Information of the Disclosing Party in breach of
                        confidentiality protections contained in this Agreement, the Disclosing Party shall
                        have the right, in addition to any other remedies available to it, to seek injunctive
                        relief to enjoin such acts, it being specifically acknowledged by the parties that any
                        other available remedies may be inadequate.

                        of the other party, in connection with a merger, acquisition, corporate
                        reorganization, or sale of all or substantially all of its stock or assets. Any
